    <p>Hi! I’m Arya Pandit — a high school student who loves astronomy, coding, and building things on the internet. I’m always trying to learn, experiment, and trying to understand a little more about how the universe works.</p>
    <p>I like to joke that people should start saying “It is rocket science” when something’s impressive instead of "It isn't". Astronomy isn’t exactly rocket science, but both make you feel small, curious, and occasionally confused in the best way.</p>
	<p>This site is where I share what I’m learning, try out new ideas, and sometimes break things while trying to make them better. If you notice anything odd or have suggestions, feel free to email me at galacticgateway@duck.com. I’m still figuring things out — but that’s half the fun.</p>
