    <p>Hey there! I’m Arya Pandit, a high schooler with a telescope in one hand and a keyboard in the other.I spend way too much time staring at the stars (and my screen), trying to make sense of the universe and build cool things like this site. I’m passionate about astronomy, web design and making things that feel just a little bit cosmic.</p>
    <p>I often joke that people should start saying “It is rocket science” when something’s impressive, instead of using “It’s not rocket science” to mean it’s easy. (Yes, I know rocket science and astronomy aren’t exactly the same thing, but just appreciate the analogy. Both of them are mind-expanding, awe-inducing and occasionally headache-generating.)</p>
	<p>This site is my little corner of the universe where I experiment, learn and occasionally break things in the name of progress. If you spot any glitches, typos or have suggestions, feel free to email me at arya.i.pandit@gmail.com. Just keep in mind—I’m just a high schooler ツ.</p>
