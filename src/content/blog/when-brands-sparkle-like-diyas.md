title: 'When Brands Sparkle Like Diyas'
description: 'Every Diwali, brands compete for attention, but the best campaigns do more than sell. They weave nostalgia, humor, and community into stories that feel like part of the festival itself. From Cadbury’s neighborhood‑first initiatives to Zomato’s playful parodies, this post explores how advertising has shifted from loud one‑way messages to full‑funnel journeys that actually connect with people.'

# Diwali ads: how five campaigns shaped the festival online

Diwali is a perfect storm for advertising. It is emotional, social and everywhere at the same time. Families gather, phones light up and brands try to earn a place in that moment. Over the last five years, Diwali ads have moved from simple TV stories to full digital ecosystems. The fun part is seeing how each brand uses creativity and tech to make the festival feel personal. Below is a deep dive into five campaigns, with visuals to embed, clear takeaways and why each approach actually matters.

## Cadbury Diwali campaigns, 2021 to 2025

### Messaging

Cadbury has long been the sweet messenger of Diwali. In recent years it stepped beyond boxes of chocolates into community support. The standout was the #NotJustACadburyAd push in 2021, where local shopkeepers could generate customized videos with Shah Rukh Khan inviting people to visit their stores. It felt playful, but it was also a lifeline during a tough period for small businesses.

Follow up ideas kept the momentum. QR coded billboards, virtual storefronts for hawkers and programs that spotlighted home based entrepreneurs turned “have a sweet” into “help someone thrive.” The message evolved from family togetherness to generosity that you can act on right away.
#### Why this is cool  
It proved an ad can be more than a film. It can be a clickable system that drives real footfall, real orders and real income. The emotional payoff stays, but the utility increases.
### Creativity

Cadbury’s creativity is less about pretty frames and more about mechanics that unlock action. In 2021 and 2022 the team produced a huge number of localized videos that felt personal in each neighborhood. Social posts, TV spots and outdoor placements worked together. The clever part was how scannable experiences bridged the gap between seeing and doing. A quick scan, a local store appears and your Diwali purchase suddenly supports someone near you.

Older creative lines like “Kuch Accha Ho Jaaye, Kuch Meetha Ho Jaaye” built the brand’s emotional base. The newer wave kept that feeling and added tools that let viewers participate.
#### Why this matters  
Personalization with a purpose turns a passive viewer into a participant. It is not only memorable, it moves numbers.
### Audience targeting

Cadbury segmented by age, platform and need. Younger viewers saw short, shareable content on Instagram and YouTube. Older viewers found nostalgic TV spots that felt familiar. E-commerce integrations and user generated content pulled in people across cities and smaller towns. Reported outcomes included millions of celebration packs sold, strong digital impressions and thousands of activated digital stores for women entrepreneurs.
#### Why this is practical  
When you meet each audience where they are, you reduce friction and widen impact. It is empathy plus distribution.
### Comparative analysis, old and new

#### Old, Kuch Meetha Ho Jaaye TV spots, 2004 to 2014

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

- **Emphasis:** Family bonds, traditional sweets, sentimental music, in person gifting
- **Format:** TV and print
- **Audience:** Broad, slightly older and family focused
- **Message:** Celebration and nostalgia
#### New, #NotJustACadburyAd and #ShopForShopless, 2021 to 2025

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g8IzMXtWogY"
    style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

- **Emphasis:** Community support, local entrepreneurship, digital empowerment
- **Format:** Social, YouTube, personalized video, interactive outdoor, user generated content, e commerce links
- **Audience:** Urban and rural, digitally engaged, segmented by region and interest
- **Message:** Generosity with practical tools

The move is from one way feelings to two way participation. Early ads delivered warmth. Newer ads invite you to do something with that warmth.

## Tanishq Diwali campaigns, 2019 to 2025

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l6DNB9R8YyY"
    style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

### Messaging

Tanishq moved from ads about men gifting jewelry to ads about women expressing identity. The Nav Raani campaign, directed by Mira Nair, treats everyday women as modern queens in their own lives. Pehli Diwali captured firsts that matter, such as a first Diwali after opening a business or joining the armed forces.

The tone stays festive, but the stories give space to agency. Jewelry becomes part of a personal milestone rather than a passive ornament.
#### Why this is cool  
It reframes Diwali from a ritual someone performs for you into a moment you claim for yourself. Ads can mirror social change and gently push it forward.
### Creativity

The production is cinematic and careful. Lighting, wardrobe and music create warmth without clichés. Scripts are brief, but precise. The team also localizes stories. A Tamil film speaks in Tamil. A Bengal story draws on Durga imagery. You get national unity without losing regional character.
#### Why it matters  
Precision makes the ad feel like it is for you rather than a generic pitch. That precision builds trust at higher price points.
### Audience targeting

Tanishq targets urban aspirational buyers and traditional buyers at the same time. Segmentation runs by occasion and identity. Distribution spans TV, YouTube, connected TV and social. Influencers and in store storytelling keep the same message across touchpoints. Tools like WhatsApp catalogues meet buyers where they chat.
#### Why it is practical  
A brand that sells considered purchases needs consistency across the journey. That includes screens and stores.
### Comparative analysis, old and new

#### Old, print and conventional TV ads, 2014 to 2018

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/68Ok8oAqAzI"
    style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

- **Focus:** Male gifting, arranged marriage contexts, traditional family structures
- **Format:** Print, prime time TV, event sponsorship
- **Tone:** Aspirational, ornate, less dialogue with the viewer
- **Limitations:** Narrow roles for women and less personalization
#### New, Nav Raani, Pehli Diwali and digital omnichannel, 2023 to 2025

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-psuZA5jZn0"
    style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

- **Focus:** Women’s empowerment, self purchasing, life milestones, regional celebration
- **Format:** Digital first short films, influencer amplification, connected TV, interactive WhatsApp catalogues
- **Tone:** Inclusive, culturally sensitive, participatory
- **Message:** Authenticity and layered identity

The shift is about message and medium. Digital platforms allow Tanishq to listen, localize and respond. That approach supported festive quarter growth even with gold price swings.

## Zomato Diwali campaigns, 2023 to 2025

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cq5IK0RQI10"
    style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

### Messaging

Zomato leaned into humor and pop culture. Mission Diwali spoofed a space launch, then pivoted to the real mission, getting mithai to your home. The line “Mithai Zomato Karo, desh ko roshan karo” clicks because it matches how families actually celebrate. Food closes the loop. Delivery completes the moment.
#### Why this is cool  
It proves you can be lighthearted and still land a clear value proposition. Humor does not dilute the offer when the offer is baked into the joke.
### Creativity

The ad uses bright color, quick cuts and a familiar festival rhythm. It feels like the chaos of a home getting ready for guests. The reveal is satisfying and timed for shares. The film is short enough to be watched in full on a phone and designed for messaging apps and stories.
#### Why it matters  
Shareability is not just an outcome, it is a design principle. When a film is easy to forward, it becomes part of the celebration.
### Audience targeting

Zomato’s reach cuts across age groups. Grandparents see familiar sweets. Younger viewers enjoy references and memes. Placement focuses on YouTube, Instagram and Facebook. A slight nudge on scarcity and occasional codes drives action among price sensitive users.
#### Why it is practical  
You meet people in their scrolling habits and you give them a reason to tap now rather than later.
### Comparative analysis, old and new

#### Old, functional food delivery ads, 2016 to 2019

![](/BlogImages/Diwali-Advertising/zomato2017-18.png)

- **Emphasis:** Discounts, speed and convenience of ordering food online
- **Format:** TV spots, static banners, app notifications
- **Audience:** Broad urban users, focused on young professionals looking for quick meals
- **Message:** Zomato as a utility service for fast food delivery
#### New, Mission Diwali and meme‑driven campaigns, 2023 to 2025

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zi8Sj_WC-Sc"
    style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

- **Emphasis:** Humor, pop‑culture parody, mithai as the emotional centerpiece of Diwali
- **Format:** Digital‑first short films, WhatsApp‑shareable clips, Instagram Reels
- **Audience:** Multi‑generational, from grandparents to Gen Z, united by festive food traditions
- **Message:** Zomato as the enabler of festive joy and togetherness

The shift is from purely functional messaging to cultural participation, positioning Zomato as part of the Diwali celebration itself.

## Flipkart Diwali campaigns, 2024 to 2025

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/psj8PBNokiU"
    style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

### Messaging

Flipkart is about upgrades and deals rather than nostalgia. In 2025 it moved into a podcast style film with Pankaj Tripathi and Raj Shamani. The dialogue uses current slang and jokey banter to pitch fashion and lifestyle upgrades. The message is simple. Diwali is a fresh start, so update the things you use daily.
#### Why this is interesting  
It tries to make a sale feel like a social moment. If the tone fits how people talk, it lowers resistance to a quick add to cart.
### Creativity

Merging influencer culture, a star who feels trustworthy and a long form format was a smart bet. The cutdowns worked across short form platforms. The meme energy helped with reach and relevance. The brand looked more youthful without abandoning scale.
#### Why it matters  
Format choice can signal brand personality. A podcast feel says “we are in your feed and your ears.”
### Audience targeting

Flipkart targets price conscious online native consumers across urban and smaller towns. The mix includes games, challenges, short videos and TV. Different creative lines speak to different segments while keeping the same core promise of upgrading your life during the festival.
#### Why it is practical  
You need breadth for volume and depth for conversion. A layered plan serves both.
### Comparative analysis, old and new

#### Old, Big Billion Days and Diwali Sale ads, 2012 to 2018

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A1osLJVeCd4"
    style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

- **Emphasis:** Blockbuster discounts, urgency, aspirational upgrades
- **Format:** TV commercials, print spreads, celebrity endorsements
- **Audience:** Mass‑market shoppers across urban and semi‑urban India
- **Message:** “Shop now, save big” during the festive season
#### New, Pankaj Tripathi x Raj Shamani podcast‑style ad, 2025

[Raj Shamani x Pankaj Tripathi Podcast-style Ad](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPiczlFAY3Y/)

- **Emphasis:** Lifestyle upgrades, Gen Z humor, influencer‑driven storytelling
- **Format:** Podcast‑style long form, reels, memes, interactive challenges
- **Audience:** Digital‑native Gen Z and millennials, with TV still covering broader demographics
- **Message:** Diwali as a time to upgrade your life, with Flipkart making it fun and trendy

The shift is from mass‑market discount shouting to culturally tuned, influencer‑powered storytelling, though fulfillment issues remain a risk to credibility.

## Paper Boat Diwali campaigns, 2019 to 2025

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6NRkf1epjMc"
    style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

### Messaging

Paper Boat sells memory before it sells a drink. The films use quiet moments and gentle music to remind people of childhood Diwalis. The idea is simple. One sip and you feel closer to home. It does not shout. It invites.
#### Why this is cool  
Minimalism can stand out during the noisiest season. In a crowded feed, a quiet story can feel more honest.
### Creativity

The stories are short, sometimes wordless. The homes look lived in rather than styled. The light is warm without feeling staged. Influencer storytelling adds a layer of real voices and personal posts. The approach has driven engagement lifts compared to generic beverage ads.
#### Why it matters  
When emotion is the product, restraint makes it stronger. You leave space for the viewer to fill in their own memories.
### Audience targeting

Paper Boat reaches urban millennials and Gen Z who want authenticity and older viewers who enjoy a window to the past. Regional language posts and small interactive touches like filters complete the mix. The diaspora angle brings distant families into the same mood even when they are far away.
#### Why it is practical  
If your promise is a feeling, you need to meet people in their language and rhythm.
### Comparative analysis, old and new

#### Old, early brand awareness ads, 2014 to 2017

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t7I6zYp0CU8"

    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

- **Emphasis:** Nostalgia and childhood memories — evoking the innocence of paper boats, monsoons and simpler times.
- **Format:** Animated short film with Gulzar’s poetic narration, distributed digitally and on select TV slots.
- **Audience:** Urban, educated millennials and young professionals who grew up in the 80s–90s, now seeking emotional connection with brands.
- **Message:** Paper Boat isn't just a drink; it’s a vessel for reliving childhood memories and emotions.
#### New, #FloatABoatCampaign, 2019 to 2025

[#FloatABoat Campaign Ad](https://www.facebook.com/mediasamosa/videos/paperboat-drinks-floataboat/209735524378747/)

- **Emphasis:** Nostalgia, memory, emotional storytelling around childhood Diwalis
- **Format:** Short digital films, influencer‑led storytelling, AR nostalgia filters
- **Audience:** Millennials and Gen Z seeking authenticity, plus older viewers drawn to nostalgia
- **Message:** Paper Boat as a memory trigger, not just a festive beverage

The shift is from quirky product awareness to deep emotional resonance, with Paper Boat now selling a feeling of homecoming during Diwali.

## Comparative media analysis, old and new formats

### Cadbury and Tanishq, TV and print versus digital and social

Early Diwali ads were static and mass aimed. They leaned on archetypes such as joint families and gifting rituals. Current ads are dynamic and segmented. They use lived experiences, participation and interactivity. The change is ideological and technical. Inclusion and generosity replace narrow roles. Brands are shifting from one-way awareness focused ads to personalised campaigns that engage customers.

#### Key contrasts

<div class="styled-table">

| Brand   | Old formats and themes                         | New formats and themes                                           | Outcome                             |
|---------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Cadbury | Family TV films and print                      | AI and UGC, digital personalization, QR actions                  | Higher participation and business lift |
| Tanishq | Male gifting and arranged marriage scripts     | Empowerment, life milestones, connected TV, WhatsApp catalogues | More inclusivity and agency         |

</div>

## Key findings across campaigns

- **Narrative over pure product push:** the strongest work invites viewers into a story and a role rather than a one click buy
- **Hyperlocal and personalized:** regional voices and micro segmentation increase relevance

- **Inclusive messaging:** broader representation builds trust and long term brand value
- **Metrics that matter:** measure participation, sentiment and sales together for a full view

- **Nostalgia with freshness:** emotions work best when curated, not repeated
- **Microsites as engines:** interactive pages turn viewers into participants and provide clean data for learning
