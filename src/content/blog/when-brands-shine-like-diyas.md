description: 'Every Diwali, brands compete for attention, but the best campaigns do more than sell. They weave nostalgia, humor, and community into stories that feel like part of the festival itself. From Cadbury’s neighborhood‑first initiatives to Zomato’s playful parodies, this post explores how advertising has shifted from loud one‑way messages to full‑funnel journeys that actually connect with people.'

# Diwali ads: how five campaigns shaped the festival online

Diwali is a perfect storm for advertising. It is emotional, social and everywhere at the same time. Families gather, phones light up and brands try to earn a place in that moment. Over the last five years, Diwali ads have moved from simple TV stories to full digital ecosystems. The fun part is seeing how each brand uses creativity and tech to make the festival feel personal. Below is a deep dive into five campaigns, with visuals to embed, clear takeaways and why each approach actually matters.

## Cadbury Diwali campaigns, 2021 to 2025

### Messaging

Cadbury’s 2021 **#NotJustACadburyAd** campaign marked a turning point in how Diwali advertising could blend emotion with technology. Instead of a generic festive film, the brand created a platform where thousands of small shopkeepers could generate personalized videos featuring Shah Rukh Khan inviting customers to their stores. It was a clever use of AI, but more importantly, it reframed Cadbury’s role: not just as a seller of chocolates, but as a facilitator of community resilience during a difficult economic moment.

The ad’s strength lay in how it layered Cadbury’s long‑standing festive associations — sweetness, gifting, togetherness — with a new dimension of _actionable generosity_. Watching SRK “endorse” the corner shop down the street gave viewers a sense of intimacy and empowerment. It wasn’t just about buying a box of Celebrations; it was about keeping a neighbor’s business alive.

By anchoring the campaign in both nostalgia and social impact, Cadbury managed to expand the meaning of Diwali advertising. The message was no longer only “share a sweet with family,” but “support your community while you celebrate.” That dual resonance is what made #NotJustACadburyAd stand out in the crowded festive season.
#### Why this is cool  
It proved an ad can be more than a film. It can be a clickable system that drives real footfall, real orders and real income. The emotional payoff stays, but the utility increases.
### Creativity

Cadbury’s creativity in **#NotJustACadburyAd** was less about cinematic polish and more about mechanics that unlocked participation. In 2021 and 2022, the brand produced thousands of hyper‑localized videos that felt personal in each neighborhood, with Shah Rukh Khan seemingly endorsing the corner shop down the street. Social posts, TV spots, and outdoor placements worked in sync, but the cleverest touch was the scannable layer: a quick scan, and suddenly your Diwali purchase supported a local store. The campaign turned a festive greeting into an actionable act of generosity.

What made this work was how it built on Cadbury’s older emotional foundation — the long‑running line _“Kuch Accha Ho Jaaye, Kuch Meetha Ho Jaaye”_ had already positioned the brand as a symbol of sweetness and goodwill. The newer wave didn’t discard that feeling; it extended it. By adding tools that let viewers participate directly, Cadbury shifted from _telling a story_ to _enabling one_. That leap — from sentiment to action — is what gave #NotJustACadburyAd its cultural weight.
#### Why this matters  
Personalization with a purpose turns a passive viewer into a participant. It is not only memorable, it moves numbers.
### Audience targeting

Cadbury segmented by age, platform and need. Younger viewers saw short, shareable content on Instagram and YouTube. Older viewers found nostalgic TV spots that felt familiar. E-commerce integrations and user generated content pulled in people across cities and smaller towns. Reported outcomes included millions of celebration packs sold, strong digital impressions and thousands of activated digital stores for women entrepreneurs.
#### Why this is practical  
When you meet each audience where they are, you reduce friction and widen impact. It is empathy plus distribution.
### Comparative analysis, old and new

- **Audience:** Broad, slightly older and family focused
- **Message:** Celebration and nostalgia
#### New, #NotJustACadburyAd and #ShopForShopless, 2021 to 2025

- **Message:** Generosity with practical tools

The move is from one way feelings to two way participation. Early ads delivered warmth. Newer ads invite you to do something with that warmth.

## Tanishq Diwali campaigns, 2019 to 2025

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

### Messaging

Tanishq’s **Pehli Diwali** campaign reframed festive advertising by shifting the spotlight from gifting to self‑expression. Instead of portraying jewelry as something bestowed, the films highlighted women marking personal milestones — a first Diwali after opening a business, after joining the armed forces, or after stepping into a new role. The production was cinematic yet intimate: warm lighting, careful wardrobe, and music that created emotional depth without slipping into cliché. Scripts were brief but precise, giving the stories space to resonate without overstatement.

By anchoring jewelry in moments of agency and achievement, _Pehli Diwali_ positioned ornaments as markers of identity rather than passive decoration. The result was a festive campaign that stayed rooted in tradition while speaking directly to contemporary aspirations, giving Diwali advertising a more progressive and personal dimension.
#### Why this is cool  
It reframes Diwali from a ritual someone performs for you into a moment you claim for yourself. Ads can mirror social change and gently push it forward.
### Creativity

The production is cinematic and deliberate. Lighting, wardrobe, and music create warmth without slipping into festive clichés, while the scripts remain brief but precise, letting the emotion carry the scene. Beyond craft, the campaign also invested in **regional authenticity**. Instead of relying on a single master film dubbed into multiple languages, the team created localized stories: a Tamil film spoken in Tamil, a Bengali film drawing on Durga imagery, and others that reflected local traditions. This approach gave the campaign a sense of national unity while still preserving cultural character.
#### Why it matters  
Precision makes the ad feel like it is for you rather than a generic pitch. That precision builds trust at higher price points.
### Audience targeting

Tanishq targets urban aspirational buyers and traditional buyers at the same time. Segmentation runs by occasion and identity. Distribution spans TV, YouTube, connected TV and social. Influencers and in store storytelling keep the same message across touchpoints. Tools like WhatsApp catalogues meet buyers where they chat.
#### Why it is practical  
A brand that sells considered purchases needs consistency across the journey. That includes screens and stores.
### Comparative analysis, old and new

#### Old, print and conventional TV ads, 2014 to 2018

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

</div>

- **Focus:** Male gifting, arranged marriage contexts, traditional family structures
- **Format:** Print, prime time TV, event sponsorship
- **Tone:** Aspirational, ornate, less dialogue with the viewer
- **Limitations:** Narrow roles for women and less personalization
#### New, Nav Raani, Pehli Diwali and digital omnichannel, 2023 to 2025

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

- **Focus:** Women’s empowerment framed as self‑worth and everyday queenship, jewelry as a symbol of identity rather than a gift
- **Format:** Single flagship cinematic film directed by Mira Nair, supported by digital amplification and brand storytelling across social and TV
- **Tone:** Regal, cinematic, aspirational, with warmth and inclusivity
- **Message:** Jewelry as a declaration of agency and modern identity — celebrating women as queens in their own lives

The shift is about message and medium. Digital platforms allow Tanishq to listen, localize and respond. That approach supported festive quarter growth even with gold price swings.

## Zomato Diwali campaigns, 2023 to 2025

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cq5IK0RQI10"
    style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

### Messaging

Zomato’s **Mission Diwali** campaign leaned into humor and pop culture with a spoof of a space launch, complete with countdowns, control rooms, and mock‑serious astronauts. The gag worked because it exaggerated the drama of a rocket mission, only to pivot to the “real” mission: getting mithai delivered to your doorstep. That twist was more than just a joke — it reframed food delivery as something nationally significant, a small but essential act that lights up the festival.

The line _“Mithai Zomato Karo, desh ko roshan karo”_ lands because it mirrors how families actually celebrate. Diwali isn’t complete without sweets, and Zomato positioned itself as the bridge between craving and fulfillment. Food closes the loop: the diyas are lit, the family gathers, and mithai arrives to seal the moment. Delivery becomes not just a service but part of the ritual.

What makes the ad effective is how it balances scale and intimacy. The space‑launch parody gives it spectacle and shareability, while the mithai punchline grounds it in everyday life. It’s playful, self‑aware, and perfectly tuned to digital audiences who enjoy memes and cultural references. At the same time, it reinforces Zomato’s brand promise: convenience that feels celebratory rather than transactional.
#### Why this is cool  
It proves you can be lighthearted and still land a clear value proposition. Humor does not dilute the offer when the offer is baked into the joke.
### Creativity

The ad uses bright color, quick cuts and a familiar festival rhythm. It feels like the chaos of a home getting ready for guests. The reveal is satisfying and timed for shares. The film is short enough to be watched in full on a phone and designed for messaging apps and stories.
#### Why it matters  
Shareability is not just an outcome, it is a design principle. When a film is easy to forward, it becomes part of the celebration.
### Audience targeting

Zomato’s **Mission Diwali** was designed to cut across generations. The spoofed space‑launch setup, with its countdowns and mock‑serious tone, appealed to younger viewers who enjoy meme culture and pop‑reference humor. At the same time, the reveal — mithai arriving at home — tapped into nostalgia for older audiences who associate Diwali with traditional sweets. Placement leaned heavily on YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook, ensuring the parody film reached digital‑first users while shorter edits circulated as shareable clips. Occasional discount codes and scarcity nudges were layered in to activate price‑sensitive segments, turning attention into orders.
#### Why it is practical  
The ad speaks to both nostalgia and meme culture, reaching older viewers through sweets and younger ones through parody. By placing long and short edits on the platforms each group already uses, Zomato made the campaign feel natural and easy to act on.
### Comparative analysis, old and new

#### Old, functional food delivery ads, 2016 to 2019

![](/BlogImages/Diwali-Advertising/zomato2017-18.png)

- **Emphasis:** Discounts, speed and convenience of ordering food online
- **Format:** TV spots, static banners, app notifications
- **Audience:** Broad urban users, focused on young professionals looking for quick meals
- **Message:** Zomato as a utility service for fast food delivery

#### New, Mission Diwali and meme‑driven campaigns, 2023 to 2025

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

</div>

- **Emphasis:** Humor, pop‑culture parody, mithai as the emotional centerpiece of Diwali
- **Format:** Digital‑first short films, WhatsApp‑shareable clips, Instagram Reels
- **Audience:** Multi‑generational, from grandparents to Gen Z, united by festive food traditions
- **Message:** Zomato as the enabler of festive joy and togetherness

The shift is from purely functional messaging to cultural participation, positioning Zomato as part of the Diwali celebration itself.

## Flipkart Diwali campaigns, 2024 to 2025

![](https://youtu.be/psj8PBNokiU?si=n_T35ihpZMZLWPrO)

### Messaging

Flipkart’s **Big Bang Sale** campaign, built around the hook _“Inteha Ho Gayi Intezaar Ki,”_ leaned on urgency and scale rather than nostalgia. The ad dramatized the anticipation of Diwali shopping through a deliberately slow build, with the refrain stretched out to mirror the feeling of waiting. Instead of quick cuts or flashy visuals, the pacing itself became the device — holding viewers in suspense until the sale reveal. The line worked as both a cultural reference and a sales trigger, exaggerating the sense of delay before the deals finally arrived.

The message was simple: Diwali is the moment to refresh and upgrade, and Flipkart is the destination where that upgrade happens. By framing the sale as an event in itself, the ad positioned shopping not as a chore but as part of the festival’s shared anticipation.
#### Why this is interesting  
The ad uses slowness and repetition to dramatize waiting itself. By stretching out the anticipation with the refrain _“Inteha Ho Gayi Intezaar Ki,”_ it mirrors how audiences feel before a big sale. That shared sense of buildup makes the eventual “add to cart” feel like release, turning delay into motivation.
### Creativity

The choice to build the film around a single nostalgic track and slow‑motion visuals was a smart bet. The stretched refrain _“Inteha Ho Gayi Intezaar Ki”_ carried the weight of anticipation, while the imagery of old possessions going out in a blaze of glory gave the campaign its spectacle. Shorter edits of the same idea worked well across digital platforms, keeping the hook intact. By leaning on nostalgia and dramatizing upgrades, Flipkart managed to look festive and larger‑than‑life without losing its core identity as the destination for deals.
#### Why it matters  
Format choice can signal brand personality. By leaning on a slow‑burn, music‑driven film built around a familiar refrain, Flipkart positioned itself as larger‑than‑life. The stretched hook _“Inteha Ho Gayi Intezaar Ki”_ made the sale feel like a cultural countdown, giving the brand a festive, event‑like presence.
### Audience targeting

The film speaks to a wide base by showing worn‑out possessions and pairing them with the stretched refrain _“Inteha Ho Gayi Intezaar Ki.”_ Older viewers connect with the nostalgic song, while younger ones respond to the idea of upgrading. One anthem‑like idea unifies both groups under the same promise: Diwali is the time to refresh.
#### Why it is practical  
A single, universal hook travels easily across demographics, making the campaign memorable without needing multiple versions.
### Comparative analysis, old and new

#### New, Pankaj Tripathi x Raj Shamani podcast‑style ad, 2025

[Raj Shamani x Pankaj Tripathi Podcast-style Ad](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPiczlFAY3Y/)

- **Emphasis:** Lifestyle upgrades, Gen Z humor, influencer‑driven storytelling
- **Format:** Podcast‑style long form, reels, memes, interactive challenges
- **Audience:** Digital‑native Gen Z and millennials, with TV still covering broader demographics
- **Message:** Diwali as a time to upgrade your life, with Flipkart making it fun and trendy

The shift is from mass‑market discount shouting to culturally tuned, influencer‑powered storytelling, though fulfillment issues remain a risk to credibility.

## Paper Boat Diwali campaigns, 2019 to 2025

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

    allowfullscreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

### Messaging

Paper Boat sells memory before it sells a drink. The films use quiet moments and gentle music to remind people of childhood Diwalis. The idea is simple. One sip and you feel closer to home. It does not shout. It invites.
#### Why this is cool  
Minimalism can stand out during the noisiest season. In a crowded feed, a quiet story can feel more honest.
### Creativity

The film is simple and wordless. A dining table gradually fills with festive food and Paper Boat drinks, lit in a warm, natural way. The slow build captures everyday celebration without over‑styling, making the brand feel authentic and part of the ritual.
#### Why it matters  
When emotion is the product, restraint makes it stronger. You leave space for the viewer to fill in their own memories.
### Audience targeting

Paper Boat appeals to urban millennials and Gen Z through its authentic, everyday visuals, while older viewers connect with the nostalgic drinks and festive setting. The simple table‑filling metaphor also resonates with the diaspora, offering a shared sense of celebration across distances.
#### Why it is practical  
If your promise is a feeling, you need to meet people in their language and rhythm.

- **Audience:** Urban, educated millennials and young professionals who grew up in the 80s–90s, now seeking emotional connection with brands.
- **Message:** Paper Boat isn't just a drink; it’s a vessel for reliving childhood memories and emotions.
#### New, #FloatABoatCampaign, 2019 to 2025

[#FloatABoat Campaign Ad](https://www.facebook.com/mediasamosa/videos/paperboat-drinks-floataboat/209735524378747/)

- **Emphasis:** Nostalgia, memory, emotional storytelling around childhood Diwalis
- **Format:** Short digital films, influencer‑led storytelling, AR nostalgia filters
- **Audience:** Millennials and Gen Z seeking authenticity, plus older viewers drawn to nostalgia
- **Message:** Paper Boat as a memory trigger, not just a festive beverage

The shift is from quirky product awareness to deep emotional resonance, with Paper Boat now selling a feeling of homecoming during Diwali.

## Comparative media analysis, old and new formats

Early Diwali ads were mass aimed. They leaned on archetypes such as joint families and gifting rituals. Current ads are dynamic and segmented. They use lived experiences, participation and interactivity. The change is ideological and technical. Inclusion and generosity replace narrow roles. Brands are shifting from one-way awareness focused ads to personalised campaigns that engage customers.

#### Key contrasts

## Infographics & Visual Insights

While the critiques and comparisons give us a detailed look at how each brand approaches Diwali, some of the patterns only really come alive when you see them visually. Advertising during the festival has never been about a single audience — it’s about weaving together multiple strands of Indian society, from young couples celebrating their first Diwali together to families in smaller towns looking for affordable gifting options. To capture this diversity, I’ve mapped out the **eight most common audience segments** that Diwali campaigns between 2019 and 2025 consistently target: urban youth, young couples and nuclear families, women professionals, Tier 2 and Tier 3 shoppers, families with children, nostalgia‑seekers, small businesses and local communities, and purpose‑driven consumers.

![](/BlogImages/Diwali-Advertising/target_audience_heatmap-20251104T135157.png)

The heatmap here shows how strongly each brand leans into these groups. For instance, Cadbury’s campaigns light up the “small businesses” and “purpose-driven customers” cells, while Tanishq is far more concentrated around the urban youth and young couples. Flipkart spreads itself across value‑driven shoppers and the youth, whereas Paper Boat sits firmly in the nostalgia corner. Zomato, unsurprisingly, dominates the urban youth and tier 2 & 3 shopper segments. Seeing this side by side makes the strategic differences much clearer than words alone.

## Key findings across campaigns

- **Narrative over pure product push:** the strongest work invites viewers into a story and a role rather than a one click buy
- **Hyperlocal and personalized:** regional voices and micro segmentation increase relevance
- **Tech backed interactivity:** AI customization, AR trials, shoppable video and QR prompts are now standard tools
- **Inclusive messaging:** broader representation builds trust and long term brand value
- **Metrics that matter:** measure participation, sentiment and sales together for a full view
- **Operations as creative support:** service performance must match the promise or the message collapses
- **Nostalgia with freshness:** emotions work best when curated, not repeated
- **Microsites as engines:** interactive pages turn viewers into participants and provide clean data for learning
